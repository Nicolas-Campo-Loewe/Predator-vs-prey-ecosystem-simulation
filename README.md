# Predator-vs-prey-ecosystem-simulation

Simulation-based relationship between predator (blue squares) and prey/plant (green squares) on a simple grid. Periodic fluctuations are formed; stability depends on selected parameters.

Code version:
-2.0-

Controls:
- [Space] - Pause/start
- [N] - Advance 1 generation (only if paused)
- [ X ] - Random reset
- [ESC] - Exit
- [F] - Alternate fullscreen
- [Left mouse click] - Adds a plant
- [Right mouse click] - Adds a predator
- [Shift + click] - Errases cell

Pameters and adjustments:
- [G/H] - +/- Plant spread probability
- [E/D] - +/- Spontaneous plant spawn probability
- [V/B] - +/- Plant spread probability
- [U/J] - +/- Mobility energetic cost
- [I/K] - +/- Energetic reproduction threeshold
- [O/L] - +/- Predator reproduction cost
- [+/-] - +/- Generations per second
